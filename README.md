# User-Scripts
A collection of short random user scripts I made that aren't worthy of a standalone repository.
## Scripts:
### CreateLinks:
A Bash script to generate a symlink for each file within folder (works with nested folders).

Usage: ```CreateLinks <Source Directory> <Destination Directory>```

### ExtractSubs:
A Bash script to extract specific subtitles ID from mkv files (used mainly to extract specific languaged subtitles from all episodes of a TV series) 

  Usage: ```ExtractSubs <File / Directory> <Track ID> <Extracted File Type (File Extension)> [<Filename Suffix>]```
