# Random-Scripts
A collection of short scripts I made that aren't worthy of a standalone repository.
## Scripts:
### CreateLinks:
A Bash script to generate a link for each individual file within folder (also works with nested folders).

Usage: ```CreateLinks <Source Directory> <Destination Directory>```

### ExtractSubs:
A Bash script to extract specific subtitles ID from multiple mkv file (used mainly to extract specific languaged subtitles from a TV series) 

  Usage: ```ExtractSubs <Source Directory> <Track ID> <Extracted File Type (Filename Extension)> [<Filename Suffix>]```
